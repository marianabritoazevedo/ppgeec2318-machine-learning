## 🧠📄 On the Societal Impact of Open Foundation Models

> Critical Analysis

Before analyzing the pros and cons of Open Foundation Models, it's crucial to understand this concept. These models, also referred to as Open FMs, are very important to modern AI ecosystems, and they can be interpreted as  "open-source code" in the AI field. Essentially, models such as BERT, BLOOM, or Stable Diffusion are readily accessible for community interaction and customization, including their weights. Consequently, these models have distinctive properties: broader access, as their weights are open to the public; greater customizability, allowing users to adapt them through techniques like quantization, fine-tuning, and pruning for diverse applications; local adaptation and inference ability, enabling users to directly employ the models without sharing sensitive data with third parties; finally, they are also characterized  for their inability to retract model access and monitor or moderate model usage.

Considering these aspects, it is crucial to analyze the pros and cons of Open FMs. These models offer numerous benefits, including distribution of the model, enabling multiple users to define acceptable model behavior, fostering innovation, accelerating scientific progress, and enhancing model transparency. Essentially, when these models are made accessible to the public, the number of contributors significantly expands, adhering to the notion that "two heads are better than one." This implies that with increased collaboration, more innovations are created when adapting these models, accelerating scientific advancements and facilitating the resolution of a broader array of issues. Additionally, the collective assessment of model behavior by a larger number of users promotes transparency and serves to mitigate monoculture and market concentration. In essence, it can be asserted that there are numerous advantages regarding this subject.

On the other hand, there are certain risks that need careful consideration. To aid in the analysis of these risks, there is a framework known as marginal risks, which assesses threat identification, current risk levels, existing defenses, evidence of potential risks associated with these models, the ease of defending against new risks, and uncertainties and assumptions. It's crucial to recognize that when these models are made publicly available, they can be utilized for bad purposes, such as spear-phishing scams, cybersecurity breaches, spreading disinformation, and various other very bad scenarios. Therefore, it is plausible that certain users might misuse these models, and given their lack of monitoring, moderation, or access revocation capabilities, these situations pose true risks. In this situation, it is important to conduct a thorough analysis to determine whether the release of such models indeed heightens marginal risks to society.

Considering all the pros and cons, I believe that there are already many Open FMs available to users, and this trend is irreversible. As the article defends, there are numerous benefits to utilizing these models. I think that as the number of contributors grows, so does the potential for generating incredible solutions, driving scientific progress, and fostering remarkable innovations. Nevertheless, it's crucial to acknowledge the risks associated with Open FMs. Hence, while it's important to maintain Open FMs, it's equally imperative to implement measures to mitigate these risks. This could involve establishing policies for model downloads, enhancing user education on responsible usage, implementing robust security measures, fostering transparency in model development, and promoting ethical guidelines for model deployment. By adopting such measures, maybe we can find a balance between reaping the benefits of Open FMs and safeguarding against potential risks, ensuring responsible and beneficial utilization of these powerful tools.

## ✏️📘 Chapter 4: Training Data

> Summarization of 10 important topics

The previous chapters of Chip Huyen's book, "Designing Machine Learning Systems," demonstrate the complex nature of ML systems, encompassing a variety of steps and techniques. However, it's crucial to recognize that one of the most important aspects of such systems is related to the training data. In the real world, we encounter data that is messy, complex, and unpredictable, often with errors or imbalanced classes. Even if we execute all other steps of the ML system in the right way, improper training data undermines the robustness of our system, leading to potential errors in our ML model. In this way, the quality of training data serves as a foundation of modern ML algorithms. Below, it is outlined ten essential concepts and techniques for creating or acquiring high-quality training data to build those systems.

1) **Sampling:** it is the process of selecting a subset of data points from real-world data to train our model. This happens because, in many cases, we don’t have access to all possible data relevant to our problem, or it may not be feasible to process all the data available to us. Therefore, this process involves strategically extracting representative samples to address our problem. In the next topics, we will explore two families of samples: nonprobability sampling and random sampling.

2) **Nonprobability sampling:** it is a sampling method where data selection is not based on any probability criteria. This type of sampling is not generally considered optimal because it may not accurately represent real-world data and can introduce biases. Examples of sampling methods using this strategy include selecting samples based on availability, having experts decide which samples to include, or choosing samples based on quotas for certain segments of data without any randomization.

3) **Random sampling:** it is a sampling method that incorporates randomness into the selection of samples for training the model. This category of sampling techniques uses many strategies, including assigning equal probabilities to all samples, dividing the population into groups and sampling from each group separately, determining weights for each data point to be selected, or employing more sophisticated methods such as reservoir sampling or importance sampling.

4) **Labeling:** this is a crucial process in training data, particularly relevant to supervised machine learning tasks, and it involves assigning a target or output label to each data point. This process can be carried out manually, although this approach is often expensive, slow, and raises concerns regarding data privacy. Alternatively, various techniques can be employed to label data (that we will check below). Additionally, there are natural labels associated with situations where the model's predictions can be automatically or partially evaluated by the system, as seen in recommendation systems, for example.

5) **Weak supervision:** it is a labeling approach that relies on heuristics, rules, or other automated methods to infer labels for the data. For instance, it involves creating functions that assign a specific class label to a data point if certain characteristics are present in the dataset. Many heuristics can be employed in this approach, including keyword heuristics, regular expressions, database lookup, or checking the outputs of other models.

6) **Semi-supervision:** it is another labeling approach that uses structural assumptions to generate new labels based on a small set of initial labels. With this method, only a small amount of data with labels is needed, and there are numerous techniques to accomplish this. These techniques include adding predicted labels with the highest probabilities to the training set, assuming that data points with similar characteristics share the same labels, or even adding small perturbations to data points without changing their labels.

7) **Transfer learning:** it is a family of methods that involves reusing a pre-trained model, initially developed for a generalized task, to create a more specific model for a second task. By fine-tuning the pre-trained model, adjustments are made to its parameters or layers to better suit the new task's requirements. This approach is beneficial when labeled data for the target task is limited, as it leverages knowledge from the source task to improve performance. Besides that, transfer learning reduces the computational resources and time needed for training while enhancing model effectiveness in many applications. 

8) **Active learning:** it is another approach to increase the efficiency of labeling in training data. In this technique, the concept uses the idea that ML models can obtain higher accuracy with fewer training labels if they have the ability to select which data points to learn from actively. This means that the model sends back queries, typically in the form of unlabeled data, to be labeled by annotators. By strategically selecting which data points to label, active learning optimizes the learning process, allowing the model to focus on the most informative instances and reducing the overall labeling effort required.

9) **Class imbalance:** it refers to a common issue encountered in ML training data, where one class is significantly more prevalent than other(s). This scenario, really common in real-world datasets, results in insufficient information for the model to accurately detect minority classes, leading to some errors. To address this challenge, many approaches are employed, such as selecting appropriate metrics to assess the problem, employing data-level methods to alter the data distribution, and utilizing algorithm-level methods to enhance the model's robustness to class imbalance.

10) **Data augmentation:** it is another set of techniques used to increase the amount of training data. These methods are highly utilized in computer vision and NLP tasks and serve to create more robust models against, allowing them to detect noise and adversarial attacks. Many approaches can be employed, including making minor transformations to the data without altering the labels (such as rotating an image or replacing a word with a synonym), introducing perturbations to data points, or synthesizing new data.

In summary, all of those concepts related to sampling, labeling, addressing class imbalance, and data augmentation are very important to increase the quality and efficacy of ML models. By carefully selecting representative samples, ensuring accurate annotations, balancing class distributions, and diversifying the training dataset, these methods collectively contribute to enhancing the robustness and reliability of ML systems. So, these concepts are very important to develop models capable of effectively tackling real-world challenges and delivering good predictions across diverse applications.
