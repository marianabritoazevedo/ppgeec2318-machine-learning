## 🧠📝 Designing Machine Learning Systems 

> 3 first chapters summary

In the initial three chapters of "Designing Machine Learning Systems" by Chip Huyen, crucial insights into machine learning systems and Data Engineering were highlighted.

The first chapter provides a huge perspective on the recent surge of machine learning, particularly with the proliferation of deep learning solutions across various domains like healthcare, business, finance, marketing, and translation. However, it emphasizes that a machine learning system encompasses more than just the developed model; it constitutes an entire ecosystem comprising business requirements, interfaces, data stack, and protocols for development, monitoring, and updating of said models, known as ML System. 

Furthermore, the chapter delves into the distinctions between academic and production machine learning settings, emphasizing the challenges in production environments such as the ever-changing nature of data and considerations like fairness and interpretability. While academic machine learning focuses on developing state-of-the-art models with exceptional accuracies and high throughput, utilizing predominantly static benchmark datasets, production machine learning focuses on meeting many stakeholder requirements and ensuring a seamless user experience with rapid inference and minimal latency, and those are important aspects to take into account when developing ML models. 

Then, the second chapter explores how metrics in business differ from those in ML projects. It discusses the essential characteristics that most ML systems should possess, namely reliability, scalability, maintainability, and adaptability. The iterative nature of ML systems, involving multiple stages from project scoping to continual learning and business analysis, is highlighted. Additionally, the author sheds light on the concept of objective functions within a model, illustrating how achieving multiple objectives may require the use of different loss functions and the importance of decoupling these functions for maintenance purposes.

Finally, in the third chapter, the fundamentals of data engineering are delved into, beginning with the premise that machine learning systems can effectively utilize data from diverse sources. The chapter discusses the various types of data inputs, including user-generated, system-generated, or internal database entries, each with distinct formats such as JSON, CSV, or Parquet. Decisions concerning storage infrastructure become paramount, encompassing considerations of cost, accessibility speed, and multimodal storage capabilities. 

Also, this chapter introduces prominent data models including the relational model and NoSQL models, discussing structured and unstructured data accommodation within these models. Toward the chapter's conclusion, important concepts in data engineering such as ETL (Extract, Transform and Load) processes, batch processing, and stream processing are underscored, along with their manifestations across various dataflows, exemplified by interactions with APIs or real-time data transport mechanisms like Apache Kafka.

The summarized chapters provide a comprehensive understanding of the incredible nature of designing ML systems. They underscore the importance of considering the broader ecosystem, encompassing business requirements, data engineering, and model development, deployment, and maintenance. Furthermore, the interplay between business objectives, model complexity, and data collection highlights the multifaceted challenges inherent in ML projects, emphasizing the need for robust strategies and frameworks to navigate these complexities effectively.
